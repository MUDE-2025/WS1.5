# Workshop 1.5: To Starve or Not to Starve

*Due: 1st October 2025*

In this workshop, you will work with data on water quality of offshore waters, namely the concetration of nitrogen (DIN) and the concentration of phosphorus (DIP). As you probably know, these variables are nutrients which are key for the growth of species of algae and molluscs that feed on them. In order to guarantee the survival of these species, a minimum amount of nutrients in the water is needed so they do not starve.
You will first calculate the covariance and correlation between the two variables, and then their joint probabilities. You will then use this to find out if your hypothetical patch of water has a sufficient level of DIN and DIP for our aquatic friends!
