    "## Part 1: Introduction and set up\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you will work with data on water quality of offshore waters, namely the concetration of nitrogen ($DIN$) and the concentration of phosphorus ($DIP$). As you probably know, these variables are nutrients which are key for the growth of species of algae and molluscs that feed on them. In order to guarantee the survival of these species, a minimum amount of nutrients in the water is needed so they do not starve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there is a growing interest in installing farms of species such as mussels and seaweed offshore due to the limited space in coastal waters. When selecting the location of one of these farms, the availability of enough nutrients in the water is checked so the farmed species can survive and the farm is economically feasible. We can check that by computing the probability of meeting the minimum amount of nutrients in the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you will first quantify the relationship between $DIN$ and $DIP$ (if they were independent, you could model them using independent univariate distributions!). As you can imagine, there is a relationship between the presence of both nutrients so, afterwards, you will model the bivariate distribution of $DIN$ and $DIP$ using a bivariate Gaussian distribution. Finally, you will use it to compute the probabilities of meeting some conditions."
